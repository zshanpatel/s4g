**Obsidian**
This is either an amazing idea or another learning curve.

**The setup**
Create a new folder labelled posts. This is where you will add your posts.
... that's all you have to do.
And, find out where your Obsidian directories are. Right click your posts folder and choose show in system explorer.
You'll need this directory in the upcoming days.
